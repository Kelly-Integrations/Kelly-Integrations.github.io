# Jekyll Theme - Single

This theme is single and ready to mingle!

Single Theme is a simple single-page website infused with the following:

1. (Bower)[https://bower.io/] to handle any front end packages that you think you may need.
2. (Bootstrap)[http://getbootstrap.com/components/] to handle your styling right off the bat. (Don't worry, you can always custome style if you want.)
3. (Holderjs)[https://github.com/imsky/holder] to handle your client-side image placeholders.

## How to use

First of all make sure to have these installed:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower)

Clone this repo into a directory on your machine:

    $ git clone https://github.com/enriquezm/jekyll-theme-single.git my-site

Install project dependecies via bower:
