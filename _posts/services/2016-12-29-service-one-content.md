During the Design stage of your project, KI will provide a thorough on-site review of your project that will help to mitigate change orders and translate into time savings during the construction phase.

We will provide follow-up reviews on plan corrections to ensure the design team has provided cost effective solutions to the identified problems.Often times contract drawings are developed from previously flawed as-built drawings.  

KI will provide experienced personnel to inspect the site, including the mechanical, electrical and IT infrastructure to identify any major issues prior to moving forward. Itâ€™s critical that all major issues are identified during this stage to allow the project to stay on budget and schedule.
