KI will perform the necessary testing to ensure your system has been built properly, is performing at it’s maximum potential and conforms to the latest applicable standards.

Anyone can start a project, but a successful system start-up and completion is accomplished with KI. Some companies assume that system start-up is the finish, walking away at this point, leaving the end users to work through issues.  

KI believes in putting a bow around each project.  This is accomplished by ensuring a proper handoff with the end user’s maintenance staff resulting in a seamless transition of the new system. We can assist in choosing a new Computer Maintenance Management System or help integrate into an already existing one if desired.
